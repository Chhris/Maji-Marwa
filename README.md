# Maji-Marwa
This is the repository of the 2022-2023 Maji Marwa Project group at The Ohio State University.

## Mission
Our group is currently researching and designing an earten dam system for the Marwa Village in rural Tanzania.
The village experiences wet and dry seasons throughout the year. During the wet seasons, the village experiences flooding that causes structural damage to the village schools, impacting the village childrens' attendance. During the dry seasons, the villagers walk hours to the Pangani River to bring water back to the village. Our earthen dam design will help manage floodwaters in the wet seasons and retain water in the dry seasons.
